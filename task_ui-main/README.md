# Task UI Challenge

This repository contains the implementation of the UI design challenge for the Flutter Developer position at Dreamsoft-IT. The project involves developing the UI for two design mockups using Flutter, with attention to responsiveness, dark mode functionality, basic animations, and unit tests.

## Approach

### UI Design and Responsiveness
- **Framework**: Used the latest Flutter SDK version.
- **Design**: Followed the provided mockups closely to ensure the UI matches the design specifications.
- **Responsiveness**: Implemented responsive design to ensure the UI adapts to different screen sizes (Mobile, Tablet, PC).

### State Management and Navigation
- **State Management**: Utilized the GetX framework for efficient state management and dependency injection.
- **Navigation**: Implemented smooth navigation between screens using GetX routing.

### Dark Mode
- **Theme Switching**: Added a button to switch between light and dark modes, ensuring consistent UI behavior and aesthetics.

### Animations
- **Basic Animations**: Incorporated simple animations to enhance user experience, such as fade-ins and transitions.

### Assumptions
- **Design Consistency**: Assumed that the mockups provided are the final design specifications.
- **Environment Setup**: Assumed that the development environment has the latest Flutter SDK installed.
- **Icons**: Used the nearest suitable icons available within the Flutter ecosystem.
